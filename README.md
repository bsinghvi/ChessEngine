# ChessEngine

## Purpose
  Eventual goal of this program is to be able to create a chess game that can be playable against another player or the computer itself.
  This game will be made in-console, but hopefully it'll be finished in a way that can be easily adapted to another medium that employs pictures and other UI enhancements.
  
## Current status
  A game can be played between two players, though players have to check for checkmate themselves. Working on invalidating illegal jumps and checkmate, while trying to make sure that each method can be later used by the computer player to make decisions.
  
## Programming language used
  I'm using Java right now, as it's OOP capabilities are easy to use and could be really vital in helping make this game efficient.
  Additionally, it can be compiled using Eclipse which makes it easy to check the code.
