# ChessEngine

## Purpose
  Eventual goal of this program is to be able to create a chess game that can be playable against another player or the computer itself.
  This game will be made in-console, but hopefully it'll be finished in a way that can be easily adapted to another medium that employs pictures and other UI enhancements.
  
## Current status
  September - Update 3.0 - The game has been fully converted to function off of Objects, specifically each piece is now its own object that follows the Piece interface. Future Updates: Finish developing the method that checks for King check, and continue development on the computer player. 
  
  May- Update 2.0 - A full length game can be played between two players while the game can check for checkmate and check by itself. Though, the players must ensure that if a king is in check, the king must be removed from check. Working to make sure the game can check for that as well. Also starting development on the computer player, but first optimizing the board class. 
  
  March- A game can be played between two players, though players have to check for checkmate themselves. Working on invalidating illegal jumps and checkmate, while trying to make sure that each method can be later used by the computer player to make decisions.
  
## Resources used
  I'm using Java right now, as I think it's OOP features are easy to use, and would really be vital in making this game.
  Additionally, I'm using Eclipse which makes it easy to check and debug the code.
